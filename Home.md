The TypeScript Wiki is for people who are interested in:

- Debugging TypeScript problems
- Using the compiler API
- Wanting to contribute to the TypeScript codebase

It is also used as a scratch-pad for one-off links which are useful when triaging GitHub issues. For example the [[FAQ]]

If you are after documentation on how to use TypeScript the langauge, or the build tool: please see: https://www.typescriptlang.org
